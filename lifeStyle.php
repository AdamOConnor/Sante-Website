                <h3>Waist Measurement</h3>
                <p class="justify">
                    BMI alone is not a good guide to who is at most
                    risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease.
                </p>
                <p class="justify">
                    Instead, waist circumference may be a much more accurate measure of future health
                    problems because what matters is where you carry your excess kilos/pounds.
                </p>
                <p class="justify">
                    People who are an apple shape - they store fat around their midriff - are far more
                    likely to develop heart disease and diabetes than those who are a pear shape or more diffusely plump.
                </p>
                <p class="justify">
                    A waist circumference greater than 80cm (32in) for women and 94cm (37in)
                    for men indicates increased risk, while a measurement of more than 88cm (35in) for women
                    and 102cm (40in) for men is particularly worrying.

                    <p class="justify">
                        An even better measurement of risk may be the ratio of your waist
                        circumference (the narrowest point on your abdomen) to your hip circumference (the widest point).

                        A ratio of more than 1.0 for a man (in other words your waist is bigger than your hips)
                        or 0.8 for a woman means you urgently need to reduce your weight and increase your levels of exercise.

                            Anxiety worsens hot flushes.

                        <p class="justify">
                            Controlling lifestyle stress and anxiety may help reduce the number
                            and severity of hot flushes associated with menopause, according to doctors at the University of Pennsylvania.

                        <p class="justify">
                            Hot flushes are perhaps the most troublesome symptom associated with approaching
                            menopause and are experienced by a majority of women during the transition to menopause.
                            Menopause - the ending of menstruation - is defined as having 12 consequtive months without a period and occurs at the average age of 51.

                        <p class="justify">
                            Researchers studied over 400 women between 37 and 47 years of ago who still had regular periods.
                            The women took tests that measured their anxiety levels at the start of the study and again following a six year period.
                            After six years, many were experiencing hot flushes and irregular periods, two signs of approaching menopause.
                            The womens anxiety scores were directly correlated with the severity and frequency of their hot flushes even when factors such as oestrogen levels,
                            smoking and stage of menopause were taken into account.  Women with the highest anxiety levels reported almost 5
                            times as many hot flushes as less anxious women, and women with moderate anxiety had hot flushes 3 times as often as those with normal levels of anxiety.
